# Experiments on conjoint parsing of Sumerian morphology and dependency syntax

To a large extent, Sumerian clausal syntax is morphologically expressed at the verb, e.g., in polypersonal agreement and dimensional affixes (that indicate semantic roles other than direct arguments). This information, even though incomplete due to idiosyncrasies of the writing system and spelling conventions) is essential for parsing, because it helps to disambiguate the attachment of nominal arguments. Similarly, nominal inflection indicates the grammatical role of the inflected noun, but also that of its parent(s). For successful dependency parsing, it is thus beneficial to perform conjoint parsing for/disambiguation of inflectional morphology and syntactic dependencies.

In this repository, we gather training, test and gold data, code for training and evaluating parsers, and scripts for data preprocessing and evaluation.
